# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Small notes to help you get started.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Keep changes small and focused; open a PR back to `main`.
3. Run tests locally before creating a PR: `python -m pytest`.
4. Add tests for new behavior and make sure all tests pass.
5. Follow the existing code style (use `black` for formatting).

If you plan to contribute larger features, open an issue first to discuss the design.
