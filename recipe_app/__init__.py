"""Package marker for the recipe_app project.

Placing this file at the top of the `recipe_app` directory makes the folder
importable as a package (`import recipe_app`) when you run Python from the
parent directory (recommended: `python -m recipe_app.app`).

This is a minimal, non-invasive change that preserves your current
`from recipe_app.*` imports.
